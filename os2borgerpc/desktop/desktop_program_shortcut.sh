# Adds/Removes programs from the desktop in Ubuntu 20.04
# Author: mfm@magenta.dk
#
# This script has been updated to automatically detect the name of
# the 'Desktop' directory in the chosen locale.
#
# Arguments:
# 1: Use a boolean to decide whether to add or remove the program shortcut
# 2: This argument should specify the name of a program (.desktop-file)
#    under /usr/share/applications/ or /var/lib/snapd/desktop/applications/
#    This parameter IS case-sensitive as some applications have
#    capitalized characters in their filename.
