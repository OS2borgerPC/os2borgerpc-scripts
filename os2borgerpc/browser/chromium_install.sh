# This script:
# 1. Install Chromium
# 2. Add a Chromium policy that:
#    - prevents Chromium from asking if it should be default browser and about browser metrics
#    - prevents the user logging in to the browser
#    - disables the remember password prompt feature.

  # DEVELOPER NOTES:
  #
  # > POLICIES:
  #
  # The policies we set and why
  #
  # Lockdown:
  # AutofillAddressEnabled: Disable Autofill of addresses
  # AutofillCreditCardEnabled: Disable Autofill of payment methods
  # BrowserAddPersonEnabled: Make it impossible to add a new Profile. Doesn't lock down editing a Profile, but it gets some of the way.
  # BrowserSignin: Disable sync/login with own google account
  # DeveloperToolsAvailability: Disables access to developer tools, where someone could make changes to a website
  # EnableMediaRouter: Disable Chrome Cast support
  # ExtensionInstallBlocklist: With the argument * it blocks installing any extension
  # ForceEphemeralProfiles: Clear Profiles on browser close automatically, for privacy reasons
  # PaymentMethodQueryEnabled: Prevent websites from checking if the user has saved payment methods
  #
  # Various:
  # BrowserGuestModeEnabled: Allow people to start a guest session, if they want, so history isn't even temporarily recorded. Not crucial.
  # BrowsingDataLifetime: Continuously remove all browsing data after 1 hour (the minimum possible),
  # except "cookies_and_other_site_data" and "password_signin",
  # because the visitor might be at the computer and still signed in to something.
  # DefaultBrowserSettingEnabled: Don't check if it's default browser. Irrelevant for visitors, and maybe you want Firefox as default.
  # MetricsReportingEnabled: Disable some of Googles metrics, for privacy reasons
  # PasswordManagerEnabled: Don't try to save passwords on a public machine used by many people
  # PrivacySandboxPromptEnabled: Don't prompt about enabling (some) ad tracking
  # PrivacySandboxSiteEnabledAdsEnabled: Disable (some) ad tracking

  # Additional info on the many policies that can be set:
  # https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/187202?hl=en
  #
  # Blocked URLs
  #
  # chrome://accessibility: It seems to have what's essentially a builtin keylogger?!
  # chrome://extensions: Extension settings can be changed here, and extensions enabled/disabled
  # chrome://flags: Experimental features can be enabled/disabled here.

  # Cleanup our previous policies if they're around (except the homepage)
